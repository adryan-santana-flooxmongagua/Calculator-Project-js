# **JavaScript Calculator Project**

## **Description**  
This repository contains the source code for a calculator developed in JavaScript. The project is part of a hands-on learning experience and explores fundamental language concepts, DOM manipulation, and programming logic.

### Project  
![Calculator](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hcode-com-br.appspot.com/o/calculadora-hcode.jpg?alt=media&token=5406aa3f-b965-401c-9b4e-654609c78b33)

## **Project Objectives**  
- Implement a functional calculator using JavaScript.  
- Learn and practice event handling with the DOM.  
- Consolidate knowledge of classes, methods, and control structures in JavaScript.

## **Why did I do this?**  
This repository serves as a record of some practical JavaScript implementations I worked on during today's course.  

## **Notice**  
This project is a hands-on implementation developed as part of a JavaScript course I am currently studying. The main goal is to document and consolidate the concepts learned, such as DOM manipulation, class creation, and control structures.  

**Important:** This repository does not represent a continuously evolving project but serves as a record of the techniques and practices explored during the course.  

### **Status**  
**Not Finished!** The code might have gaps, errors, or areas for improvement. As I progress through the course, I will update and fix issues as needed based on what I learn.
